# PingOverlay

Description:
PingOverlay is designed to provide real-time monitoring of your connection. Users have full control over various aspects such as Textfont, Size, Location, Textcolor, Ping interval, and server all adjustable within the SettingsForm. By displaying all currently active connections in a listbox, users can easily select the desired server for monitoring. The primary objective of this project is to ensure that gamers always have visibility of their ping to the game server while playing. The overlay only presents the numerical values (ping) of the server, typically positioned at the top-right corner of the screen. The overlay remains in the foreground (TopMost), ensuring constant visibility without obstructing gameplay.

Note: This is a small Project and honestly not well written/designed.
