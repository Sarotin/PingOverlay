# PingOverlay

Description: Unfortunately, some games still don't provide the option to display the ping, so I created this small application called PingOverlay. Its purpose is to offer real-time monitoring of your connection. With PingOverlay, users have complete control over various aspects such as text font, size, location, text color, "run on startup," and ping interval, all adjustable within the SettingsForm. By presenting all currently active connections in a listbox, users can easily select the desired server for monitoring. The main objective of this project is to ensure that gamers always have visibility of their ping while playing. The overlay only displays the ping (server response time) in milliseconds, positioned at the top-left corner of the screen(default setting). The overlay remains in the foreground (Topmost), ensuring constant visibility without obstructing gameplay. You can access the SettingsForm by right-clicking the trayicon.
